To run my project eeither download the entire repository and open index.html in a browser or open the deployed application at this link, .....

To use my project, click the start button, you will be prompted with a question, click an answer and the next question will appear. When an incorrect
answer is chosen time will be deducted from your timer. If the timer hits 0 seconds, the game will end. If you answer all the questions before the timer 
runs out, the game will end in that scenario as well. When the game is over, you will be asked to enter your initials and click submit. Your score will
then be stored in localStorage and displayed on the screen. Notice, the score is directly reflective of the time left in the game, so the faster and more
correct answers chosen, the better score you will receive. If you want a brand new set of scores, click the clear scores button at the end, and enjoy an 
empty list.

I watched [this youtube video](https://tinyurl.com/ms4u7nnw) to get me started. I went off on my own after the html and css were initially set up. I needed
a jumping off point. 

Screenshots: I was so in the zone while writing this that I forgot to do a lot of commits and forgot to take screenshots along the way.
